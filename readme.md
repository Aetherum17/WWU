# WWU

World of Warcraft Universalis is an ambitious project that attempts to recreate the Warcraft universe as we know it so far. We aim to integrate the world of Warcraft seamlessly into the gameplay systems of Europa Universalis 4, creating an unique playing experience. Created by **Jaymez** and **Xylozi**, developed by **Vawser**, **Dogabeey**, and **Elyseon**, maintained by **Aetherum** since *1.28* version.

## Features:

1) More than 3000 provinces to explore.
2) Hundreds of Playable Countries.
3) Familiar Characters, Religions and Cultures.
4) New Events and Decisions.
5) Variety of New Mechanics.

## Installing via GitHub
Important Note: Github version is actively developing version and should not be used except for testing purposes. It's very likely unstable, unfinished and may not work at all.

1. Download the file from [https://github.com/Aetherum17/WWU/archive/refs/heads/master.zip]
2. Open EU4 Launcher and and click Mod Tools->Create a Mod
3. Enter mod name as wwu and version as you wish and enter mod path as mod/WWU.
4. Extract the contents of master.zip/WWU-master FOLDER to C:\Users\<user name>\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod\WWU
5. Mod will show up in mod list as local mod. You might need to restart the launcher!

###(OPTIONAL) If you want to stay UP-TO-DATE with latest github updates:
1. Download and Install Github Desktop [https://desktop.github.com/], or any other Git client of your choice. Instructions are written for Github Desktop.
2. Create a Dev Mod via EU4 Launcher
3. Go to All Installed Mods -> Mod Tools -> Create a mod.
4. In the Name put wwu_dev - though, it can be any - just do not use spaces or special characters.
5. In the Version put 1.0 - though, it can be any number.
6. In the Directory add wwu_dev after the mod/ - remember, that it should match the Name from step 2.2.
7. In tags select Alternative History - though, you can select anything else - it does not really matter as long as at least one is selected..
8. Delete descriptor.mod inside the Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis 4\mod\esu_dev\ folder.
9. In GitHub Desktop navigate to File -> Clone Repository.
10. Navigate to the URL tab.
11. Paste [https://github.com/Aetherum17/WWU] into the URL field.
12. Set the Local Path field to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis 4\mod\wwu_dev.
13. IMPORTANT - Git Desktop creates a subfolder in the local path line and names it as the Git Repository is called. So make sure to delete those subfolder in the Local Path address.
14. If you have forgotten to do so - just cut and paste all the files from the subfolder one level up. So you would have mod/wwu_dev/common folder structure.
15. Note, that sometimes the hidden .git folder is not copied, and the Git Desktop cannot find your repository. In this case press Locate button and set the updated path to your wwu_dev folder.
16. Click "Clone" and wait for the mod to download.
17. Add the new, local version of ESU to a playset, and you should be good to go!
