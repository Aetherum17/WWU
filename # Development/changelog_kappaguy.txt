# History
- Rastakhan Zandalar received the Greatest Blessing which extends his life to 250 years. It's just over 100 years since the first bookmark.

# Events
- Once a new ruler of Zandalar is chosen, loa blessings are available to choose from, extending lives to 150, 200, or 250 years.

- After selecting the option to take away the Thunderking's power in the "Lei Shen's Body" event, the ruler of Zandalar becomes truly immortal, thus removing the lifespan limit set by the blessing.

# Bugfixes
- After the naga and pirate invasion of Zandalar, the province that was initially colonized ceases to be a colony and becomes a full province
