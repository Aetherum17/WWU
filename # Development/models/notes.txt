# Porting
Using Blender 3.3: 
1. Create new PDX Material
 - PdxMeshStandard almost always
 - PdxMeshAlphaBlend for textures with cutout transparency
 
2. Assing the PDX Material by:
 - Click on the normal material in the Scene Collection
 - Click on the Material Properties tab
 - Click on the icon for Browse Material to be linked
 - Browse to the new PDX material created, select it. This will clear the texture assignments, so REMEMBER the texture filename
 
 # In the Material Properties tab
 - Click on Base Color, select the diffuse texture this material used before
 - Click on Specular -> Image, select the specular texture this material should use. For the mod, no_spec.dds is used most of the time.
 - Click on Normal -> Color -> G, select the normal texture this material should use. For the mod, no_normal.dds is used most of the time.
 
# Textures
When porting the WOW png textures, several may appear to utilise transparency. 
In some cases this is true, but for buildings in particular, these should be saved as .DDS directly, without the creation of an alpha channel.

For newer expansions, some textures are exported from wow.export with a redunant alpha channel. These tend to be the textures that look empty until they are opened. 
The alpha channel needs to be deleted.
