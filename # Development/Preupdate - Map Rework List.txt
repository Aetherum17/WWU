1. Canals:
-Add some sort of information about their location, and something to show they are open
-Somehow make sure Zone of Control will not block passing
-Clicking on Canal GP still somethimes crashes the game

2. Map Adjustments:
Eastern Kingdoms:
-Adjuste Crestfal(4107) to border sea zones between Tempest Swell and Sea of Menethil/Chilling Gulf
-Make Crestfall(4107) into 3/4 provinces? Also, its state, Drisburg, doesn't make sense, since Drisburg is city in Kul'tiras. So, we can rename it to Crestfall
-Balor is random with its position. It's part of Vash'jir, for some reason. Maybe we move it closer to Stormwind, and make it a part of EK?
-Add Channel Islands somewhere? Optional
-Sunveil Excursion(869) position is broken

Kul'tiras:
-Divide one continent into 3 zones
-Divide trade zones to Mechagon and Kul'tiras(or into 3 zones like above)
-Islands of Tol Ronal(4109), Tol Dagor(4108) and Zul'Dare(691) could be moved around, so they have more strategic value(Optional)

Mechagon - Broken Isles:
-Possibly adjust provinces to allow chain claiming(Optional)

Northrend:
-Jorundall(4104) could be moved to border Sea of Halvarde. Alternativly, sea zones need to be adjusted, since nobody can claim it with normal way.

Zandalar - Pandaria:
-Possible movement of islands/sea zones, to allow chain claiming. Alternativly, moving Isle of Bones area closer to Zandalar (and making it part of Zandalar continent)

Kezan:
-Moving Mount Kaja(4088) and Volcanic Runoff(4087) closer to Island of Kezan? (Optional)

South Seas:
-Verdant Wilds(4071) could be moved closer to Tel'abim
-Islands in general, could be moved around, so you can chain claim to Kalimdor

Kalimdor:
-Any way for countries on Azuermist/Bloodmist/Teldrassil to get to mainland?
-Terra Incognita (3476) is not revealed for countries in Kalimdor, while being part of the mainland

Isle of Dorn and The War Within Lands:
-At least add basic tags and reason to go down to their area (or from it)

Firelands:
-Movement between left and right island was bugged, needs check and possible fix for pathing

Terra Incognita:
-See bug-fix-balance For the record
