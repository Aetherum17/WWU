-Mission: Neferseet Scouts, Imminent Invasion
-event no1 (option b), no2-no6 most likely an issue of option 1b
-Reverse target of relations in New Reality
-Mission: The Temple of Ammon (most likely the effect)
-Mission: An Unexpected Offer - Ahn Qiraz cant be allied because of religion (then again that depends on previous religion switch event so it isnt really an issue)
-Cthun is present flag doesnt seem to work (possibly was a triggered modifier that changed)
