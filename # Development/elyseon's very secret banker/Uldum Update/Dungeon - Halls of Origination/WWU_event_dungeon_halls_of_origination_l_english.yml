 wwu_dungeon_halls_of_origination.1.title: "Entering Halls of Origination"
 wwu_dungeon_halls_of_origination.1.desc: "Until recently, little has been known of Uldum's Halls of Origination - save that they were constructed by the ancient and godlike titans, the beings responsible for many of Azeroth's races. Recent findings, however, suggest that the halls are among the most important titan creations in the world. The sand-filled pyramid is an archaeologist's delight, filled with relics of an earlier age and the fearsome automated defenses that protect them. But a greater treasure is rumored to lie hidden deep within the halls - a secret that could endanger all life on Azeroth. The armies threatening Uldum know of this secret, and they hope to use it as a weapon. Finding, entering and protecting the Halls of Origination is no longer a matter of academic interest."
 wwu_dungeon_halls_of_origination.1.a: "Whatever lies within await us!"
 wwu_dungeon_halls_of_origination.1.b: "The protectors of the halls await us! We will communicate with our keepers within one way or an other!"
 
 wwu_dungeon_halls_of_origination.2.title: "Maker's Overlook"
 wwu_dungeon_halls_of_origination.2.desc: "While you walk within the first room, you immediately learn the gravity of your situation when stumbling over the bodies of those who have entered the Halls of Origination before you, seeking power... and failing. It will require more than guidance to advance upward, while you unlock the secrets of these halls! You notice three magnificent statues of the constructs that watch over the zone, each with a different crown. Where could this area lead?"
 wwu_dungeon_halls_of_origination.2.a: "Deserters... And we haven't even began."
 
 wwu_dungeon_halls_of_origination.3.title: "Chamber of Prophesy"
 wwu_dungeon_halls_of_origination.3.desc: "The column-strewn Chamber of Prophecy is truly a testament of time. In a room adorned with the relics of an ancient culture, two arks await investigation, protected by ever-faithful servants. Those who wish to proceed forward must answer to Temple Guardian Anhuur, the overseer of this chamber and a master of holy magic and devastating hymns."
 wwu_dungeon_halls_of_origination.3.a: "Try to communicate with Anhuur."
 wwu_dungeon_halls_of_origination.3.b: "It's time for our weapons to make the talking!"
 
 wwu_dungeon_halls_of_origination.4.title: "Confortation with Guardian Anhuur"
 wwu_dungeon_halls_of_origination.4.desc: "We made our choice and its time to confort Temple Guardian Anhuur. Luck favors the bold!"
 wwu_dungeon_halls_of_origination.4.a: "Our attempt to approach him diplomatically was successful and he will let us pass!"
 wwu_dungeon_halls_of_origination.4.b: "Where diplomacy failed, our weapons succeeded! The guardian lays defeated and we move forward to the unknown!"
 
 wwu_dungeon_halls_of_origination.5.title: "Confortation with Guardian Anhuur"
 wwu_dungeon_halls_of_origination.5.desc: "Across from the Chamber of Prophecy we came across a splitting corridor with a device in the middle. The device seems to be connected to an inactive elevator. In one side of the room seems to lead to an outside part of the complex while the other even deaper to it."
 wwu_dungeon_halls_of_origination.5.a: "We should go deaper into the facilities. We don't know if the other corridor will take us where we want to."
 wwu_dungeon_halls_of_origination.5.b: "We should go to the exposed part of the complex. It would be a nice break to catch our breath."
