- Adjusted the faction membership to better match each bookmark.
- Cleaned up the history for each bookmark.

# Gameplay
- Orcish Horde spawning now changes the clan that spawns it into the Orcish Horde tag first. This means the clan retains its Draenor holdings as the Orcish Horde.
- Faction Demands from the faction leader now add a opinion debuff to the faction members.

- Changed the Faction Roster demands: 
 - The Demand will now appear for each member, and they can decide on the amount to send (if any).
 - Sending nothing will add -25 opinion with the faction leader, whereas sending anything will add 25 opinion with the faction leader
 - Added new demands:
  - Demand Army Officers (Army Tradition)
  - Demand Navy Officers (Navy Tradition)
  - Demand Administrative Assistance (ADM)
  - Demand Diplomatic Assistance (DIP)
  - Demand Military Assistance (MIL)
  - Demand Loan (Trade Coalition only)

- Added "Greymane Wall" monument:
 - Is added via the "Build the Wall" event that occurs if Gilneas is at war with a Scourge nation.

- Local Concern:
 - Added Worgen type, appears after the Archmage's Offer event for Gilneas, if Gilneas accepts the Curse of the Worgen.
 - Will appear like the other types, but has special flavour event that will also change the province culture to Worgen if it is one of the supported cultures (human or night elf).

- Added new disaster: Curse of the Worgen
 - Occurs when Worgen culture provinces are present in human/night elf nations.
 - Spawns worgen rebels when active, and prompts a 'plan of action' during this.
 - The Plan of Action may be:
    - Purge: which spawns several worgen rebel stacks, and adds 3 global unrest for 10 years.
    - Tolerate: which reduces global tax modifier by 33% and adds 1 global unrest for 10 years.
    - Accept: which changes your nation to the Worgen version of its culture, adds the Worgen tech group and a unique modifier bonus.

- Added new disaster: Northgate Rebellion
 - Simulates Lord Darius Crowley's rebellion against Greymane
 - There are two outcomes from the disaster: Greymane wins and imprisons Crowley, or Crowley wins and imprisons Greymane, and replaces him as the ruler of Gilneas.
  - Crowley winning will imprison Greymane.
  - Greymane winning will imprison Crowley and will apply Gilnean Isolation.

- Changed "Release Crowley" decision: now removes "Imprisonment of Crowley", adds 300 mil power and spawns 5 infantry.
- Added "Release Greymane" decision: removes "Imprisonment of Greymane", adds 300 dip power, 1 stability and restores Genn Greymane as the ruler.
- Added "Cease Gilnean Isolation" decision: requires Gilneas to rejoin the Alliance and have 250 adm power, removes "Gilnean Isolation" and 250 adm power.
- Added new government form: "Worgen Pack". Used by the feral worgen nations.
- Added spawning event for "Wolf Cult" and "Nightbane".

- Changed the "Education of X" event:
 - Now allows for the former ruler's class to be immediately learnt by the new ruler, for a small cost. Can be ignored instead to gain a small amount of prestige.
 
- Mantid "Domination of Pandaria" mission now only requires the six main regions for its trigger.

- Added automatic ideagroup removal for later bookmarks so the player doesn't feel locked into the automatic selection.
 
# Removal
- Removed the Beyond the Dark Portal and Frozen Throne bookmarks, as the other bookmarks cover the same period and supporting more than one bookmark for each major period is not needed.

# Bugfixes
- Fixed Twilight's Hammer spawning with Void religion instead of Twilight Cult.
- Fixed bug that meant the Old Horde roster wasn't made visible when the Old Horde is setup.
