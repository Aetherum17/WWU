# TODO
#--------------------------------------
Implement events for each age:

Rise of the Horde
 - Ends when Dark Portal is built
 - Go over current event setup, make it a bit less convoluted
 
Orcish Horde 
 - Ends when Orcish Horde capital (Outland Dark Portal) is sieged
 - Add events for First War/Second War lore incidents
 - Add stuff to encourage Stormwind/Orcish Horde clash
 - Add spawn setup for Orcish Horde
 
Scourge - Third War
 - Ends when Icecrown Citadel is sieged
 - Add spawn setup for the Scourge/Scourge of Lordaeron

Burning Legion - Endgame threat
 - Add spawn setup for the Burning LEgion
 
Each age progression will automatically occur after 100 years so the game doesn't become frozen due to AI failure
 
Change event pictures to the slimline versions

Add monuments
