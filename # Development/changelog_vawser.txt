# Game Configuration
- Made the effect tooltips for the feature toggles clearer so the player can understand what each toggle does.

# Story
- AI Scourge will now gain all of Icecrown if there is no player nation in Northrend when they spawn.
- Open Dimensional Portals decision is now available to non-Fel non-Orc nations on Draenor after year 650. This will make the Collapse of Draenor much more likely, and cause Outland to occur more often during playthroughs.

# Warcraft Factions
- AI behavior with regards to leaving or kicking is now more consistent. New AI members will not try and leave for 10 years minimum, and the leader (if AI) will not try and kick new members for 10 years minimum.

# Estates
- Added "None" option the Sale of Titles sell price estate action event, allowing the player to not sell if they want.

# Government Reforms
- Added "Construction Guilds" to the Tier 20 reform list. 
 - build_time = -0.1
 - Enables Construction Fervor bonus for 10 years in provinces after a building has been constructed, granting the following modifiers:
  - Development Cost Modifier: -25%
  - Great Project Upgrade Time: -25%
  - Prosperity Growth: +33%

# Missions
- Adjusted Thorium Brotherhood tradegood mission requirements to account for the new trade good distribution.

# Balance

- Reduced the DIP cost per Province in the Culture Management feature to 1.
