# Peace Terms
- Added "Quell the Scourge of Lordaeron" term: allows anybody fighting both the Scourge and the Scourge of Lordaeron to easily annex any occupied provinces owned by the Scourge of Lordaeron for a fixed 20 warscore. This is to allow the Scourge in the Eastern Kingdoms to be pushed back without requiring Northrend to be sieged down.
- Added "Quell the Cult of the Damned" term: allows anybody fighting both the Scourge and the Cult of the Damned to easily annex any occupied provinces owned by the Cult of the Damned for a fixed 20 warscore. This is to allow the Scourge in the Eastern Kingdoms to be pushed back without requiring Northrend to be sieged down.
