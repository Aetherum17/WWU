  - There is a internal cooldown of 365 days for the development migration decisions.
  - Both decisions require the base tax/production/manpower to be atleast 2/2/2 to appear.

- Added missions for:
 - Bloodsail
 - Kunzen
 - Vashj'ir
 - Deepholm

# Balance
- Reduced the combat dice roll to 6 (from 10) to make combat outcome more dependant on one's own modifiers and not RNG.
- Reduced the land share hit taken when noble or religious rebels siege down a province.
 - Additionally, they only take land if they are disloyal when the siege occurs.
- Added +1 free leader slot for every 200 development.
- Monuments now require the province to be in a state before they will provide their modifiers.
- Changed the stat growth in the Spellcaster system to only use 5 tiers, the Improve X decisions will now always change the tier ranking when used.
 - Added an increasing cost for each improvement in a tier, and added a cooldown to usage so you can't immediately get to Legendary in all stats.
 
- Changed the design of Development:
 - Base Cost now starts at 200.
 - Improve Base Tax, Production and Manpower actions cap at 30. Other sources of increase can still make it exceed this value however.
 - Each development reduces cost by 0.5%. 
 - This means low development provinces cost more, as a province with little infrastucture would require greater effort to improve.
 - Whereas highly developed provinces cost less since they already possess infrastructure, making it easier to grow.
 - In general, this encourages focused development as you would see in reality, and discourages even development across multiple provinces as is encouraged in vanilla.

- Changed Settlement Growth (colonist development mechanic):
 - Now always grants 1 development once a year instead of being chance based.

# Misc
- Standardized the disaster icons so they follow the same graphical look.

# Bugfixes
- Estate agenda now consider upgraded versions of buildings in the agenda that ask you to build certain buildings.
- Changed Spellcaster personality into "Spellcaster Capabilities" ruler modifier. This is to avoid instances where a ruler can have a full complement of personlities and then attempt to learn Spellcasting and have it fail to add the personality.
- Fixed a bug with the spellcasting stat gain decisions that meant they would never let you go beyond Poor skill.
- Pirate nations with Tirasian culture no longer get Kul Tiras NIs.
