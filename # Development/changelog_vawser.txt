# Peace Terms
- Added "Quell the Scourge of Lordaeron" term: allows anybody fighting both the Scourge and the Scourge of Lordaeron to easily annex any occupied provinces owned by the Scourge of Lordaeron for a fixed 20 warscore. This is to allow the Scourge in the Eastern Kingdoms to be pushed back without requiring Northrend to be sieged down.
- Added "Quell the Cult of the Damned" term: allows anybody fighting both the Scourge and the Cult of the Damned to easily annex any occupied provinces owned by the Cult of the Damned for a fixed 20 warscore. This is to allow the Scourge in the Eastern Kingdoms to be pushed back without requiring Northrend to be sieged down.

# Icons
- Adjusted the deity icons to use the image in an circular border icon format for all of them.
 - Remade a few images that were not of sufficient quality.

# Bugfix
- Pretender rebels that rise due to low Legitimacy (or other government legitimacy type) will now only occur once every 5 years, to prevent pretender spam.
