# Missions
- Added Kul Tiras mission tree.
- Added Burning Legion mission tree.

# Flavour
- Added support for the Gorian Empire to have a unique form of the Old Horde government if they take control of the Old Horde faction.

- Set the papal seat assigement to a dummy tag called Fel. This is to allow the Burning Legion to use the pope mechanics properly.
 - The Burning Legion will automatically claim the papal controller position from them after investing unholy influence.
- Burning Legion can now use the Fel 'pope' actions.
- Added +2 Unholy Influence to the Burning Legion government reform.
- Unholy Influence now grants a reduction to missionary maintenance cost based on the current amount held, capping at -100% at 200 points.
 
# Invasion
- Changed the Invasion mechanic slightly:
 - Removed the "Start Invasion" diplomatic action:
 - Added "Elemental Invasion" and "Demonic Invasion" casus belli.
  - The first siege won during wars with these casus belli will add a free core to the province.
  - You will only be able to have one invasion war at any one time.
 - If these casus belli are used, then the usage of the "Teleport Army" diplomatic action is free for one use.
 - Changed the Elemental estate privileges:
  - Overwhelming Force privilege now reduces the cooldown of Teleport Army to 30 days (365 by default)
  - Invasion Preparation privilege now removes the military power cost of Teleport Army.
  
# Burning Legion
- The Burning Legion now have an unique peace term: "Absorb into the Burning Legion"
 - This will convert the target to Fel and makes them a Demonic Vassal, which is a unique type of march.
  
# Balance
- Seize land now takes a different amount of land share from each estate.
  
# History
- Added alliance between Dark Iron and Firelands.
