- Army Professionalism now reduces normal troop cost when low, and reduces Specialist troop cost when high (+ the old high military bonuses).
- Recruiting Specialists now grants 3 Army Professionalism upon recruitment.

- Moved the Invoke Domain Magic action back to decisions. The ruler aspects are still within the Ruler view event however.

- Loss of the Nightwell disaster now occurs when the a Nightborne nation loses the Nighthold rather than requiring the Nightwell province modifier to be inactive.
 - Added new events to the disaster and re-worked the design so you have a set mana supply at the start, with the random events reducing or raising the supply. 
 - Regaining the Nighthold province will end the disaster with no chances.
 - Losing all of your mana supply will end the disaster and make you Withered.

- Removed the migration mechanic from the governments that used it. They now operated like settled tribes.
 - Replaced instances of migration_cost with suitable replacement modifiers.
 
- Changed the way the Old God's are killed. You now use a peace term to kill them, rather than a decision.
- Changed the way the Old God summoning can be stopped. You now use a peace term to stop their summoning, rather than a decision.

- Strom'kar effect against trolls now causes them to always lose their general if they lose a battle against the holder of Strom'kar (replaces old triggered modifier).
- Changed the Alliance/Horde Fervor triggered modifiers into a temporary modifier that is applied when a battle is one against the other.

- Removed the usage of migration from governments due to the AI spamming the migrate action.
- Reduced usage of heavy trigger scopes such as any_country where possible.
- Fixed the Bless Jotunheim/Dragonflayer mission event so it actually makes them ally with the Scourge.
