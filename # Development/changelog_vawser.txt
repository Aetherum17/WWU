# Additions
- Added ruler history for nations missing default rulers during the bookmark dates.
- Added "Pass the Mantle of Leadership" decision that allows players to exile their immortal ruler if their country has one.
- Added colonial regions to the Dragon Isles (therefore removing trade companies there).
- Added 6 'deities' for the Bananas religion.
- Added 6 'deities' for the Zangar/Sporemounds religion.

- Replaced Lucky Nations mechanic with Divine Fate system:
 - This adds bonuses to AI similar to Lucky Nations, but also provides bonuses during AI vs. AI wars specifically.
  - The bonuses scale based on the stage of the game, ramping up into the late-game.
 - This change is to allow the lucky AI to expand and become a threat to the player without giving them massive bonuses in a war vs. the player.
 
- Added "Succumb to Fel" decision, allowing Orc clans to convert to Fel outside of the Rise of the Horde event chain.
- Added "Construct the Dark Portal" decision. This replaces the event chain version, and is now how you build the Dark Portal. It is available without reaching the end of the Rise of the Horde event chain, but costs more if built before then.
 
# Balance
- Reduced the effectiveness of Concentrate Development.
- Added a "Has X Years Passed" requirement for most inventions so they appear in a more linear fashion throughout the game, no matter the start date.
- Added some new modifiers into the Ideagroup sets.
- AI will no longer immediately use the Awaken X Old God decisions whenever possible, instead they will do them after a certain date.
- Decreased Settlement Growth chance to add development to 20% (was 100%).
- Increased base development cost to 250 (was 200).
 
# Bugfixes
- Added landmass for the Skywall provinces so they don't look like weird sea provinces.
- Restricted AI development action to 30 or *2 base so small AI nations don't super-develop their capitals.
- Fixed the high lake terrain.
