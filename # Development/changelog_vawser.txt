# Hold System
- Added a special system for nations that live or explore underground.
 - This affects Kobolds, Troggs, Furbolgs, Quillboars, Titans, Earthen and Dwarves.

- If a nation is one of the valid Hold races, their capital will automatically be a Underground Hold.
- Other provinces may become Underground Holds if they are owned by a valid race, and have the following terrain: Complex, Hills, Mountains, Underground.

- Holds start at Depth Level 0, and can be expanded to reach Depth Level 10. Each level provides benefits, with a small penalty to state maintenance.
- Holds are improved via development primarily. The Depth Level will change at the following breakpoints: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50

- There are flavour events for each of the Hold races that interact with this system.

# Province Menu
- Added option to Build Hold in a valid province for 500 ducats.
