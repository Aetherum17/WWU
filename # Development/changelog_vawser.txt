Implement events for each age:

Scourge - Third War
 - Ends when Icecrown Citadel is sieged
 - Add spawn setup for the Scourge/Scourge of Lordaeron

Burning Legion - Endgame threat
 - Add spawn setup for the Burning LEgion
 
Each age progression will automatically occur after 100 years so the game doesn't become frozen due to AI failure
