# Changelog
#--------------------------------------
# Government
- Added "Naval Acumen" to the Admirality form: 
 - Provides a scaled modifier based on current Naval Acumen. 
  - Acumen is gained via the boost button, being at war and being legitimate.
  - Acumen is lost at peace, via war exhaustion and passively as the scaled modifier grows.
  - Added "Accrue Naval Acumen" action: spend DIP power to gain Naval Acumen
  - Added "Slacken Standards" action: spend Naval Acumen to gain sailors.
  - Added "Extend Service Duty" action: Spend Naval Acumen to gain naval maintenance reduction.
  
# Peace Terms
- Added "Quell the Scourge of Lordaeron" term: allows anybody fighting both the Scourge and the Scourge of Lordaeron to easily annex any occupied provinces owned by the Scourge of Lordaeron for a fixed 20 warscore. This is to allow the Scourge in the Eastern Kingdoms to be pushed back without requiring Northrend to be sieged down.
- Added "Quell the Cult of the Damned" term: allows anybody fighting both the Scourge and the Cult of the Damned to easily annex any occupied provinces owned by the Cult of the Damned for a fixed 20 warscore. This is to allow the Scourge in the Eastern Kingdoms to be pushed back without requiring Northrend to be sieged down.

# Bugfix
- Pretender rebels that rise due to low Legitimacy (or other government legitimacy type) will now only occur once every 5 years, to prevent pretender spam.
