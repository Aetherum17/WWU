- Added "Alliance Garrisons" action: adds global_unrest modifier to all Alliance members. Can be stacked up to global_unrest = -3
- Added "Communal Support" action: adds global_tax_income and diplomatic_upkeep modifier to all Alliance members. Can be stacked up to global_tax_income = 18 and diplomatic_upkeep = 3
- Added "Freedom of Information" action: adds technology_cost and idea_cost modifier to all Alliance members. Can be stacked up to technology_cost = -0.075 and idea_cost = -0.075
- Added "Virtues of the Alliance" action: adds ae_impact modifier to all Alliance members. Can be stacked up to ae_impact = -0.15
- Added "Unite the Alliance" action: if all other actions have been completed, then all Alliance members with relations above 0 are annexed by the leader.

# Diplomacy
- Call to War diplomatic action should be accepted more often.
- War Assist event should now more often cause the AI nation to accept the call to war.

# Balance
- Relentless Conquest no longer works with Sow Terror/Coup de Grace, i.e. only the main province will be ceded, the others will simply be controlled as normal.
