# Magic
- Overhauled the magic system.
 - There are now two windows within the Court view:
  - Magical Study
  - Spellbook
 - Both are accessed via the Spellbook button next to the Abdicate Ruler button.
 
 - Magical Study:
  - Available when the ruler is not a spellcaster.
  - Costs 100 ADM, DIP and MIL to start (20 for spellcaster classes or Free Magic reform)
  - Each month between 0.1 and 1.0 Study Progress is added.
  - Once at 100% Study Progress, the ruler will become a spellcaster.
  - You can spend gold to boost Study Progress by 5. However the cost will double each time (up to x10). This resets between each ruler.

# Sound
- The Old Gods will now whisper to unsuspecting players.
