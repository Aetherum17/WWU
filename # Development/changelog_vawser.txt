# Game
- Added a Game Configuration menu, allowing you to toggle various aspects of the mod on or off. 

- Feature Configuration covers:
 - Isolation mechanics
 - Federations
 - Racial modifiers
 - Magic mechanics
 - Archaeology mechanics
 - Alliance Restrictions (based on warcraft lore)
 
- Difficulty Configuration covers:
 - Vanquisher System

- Content Configuration adds the ability to toggle the 'content' of each continent, basically removing all nations in that described region.
 - This is to allow those that struggle to run the game to reduce the number of nations present.

# Missions
- Added Kul Tiras mission tree.
- Added Burning Legion mission tree.
 - Added the old Demonic Vanguard missions to this tree.
- Adjusted the Scourge mission trees:
 - The Scourge secondary tree now includes the missions from the Scourge of Lordaeron tree, allowing the player to experience the tree without needing to switch to the Scourge of Lordaeron.
 - Added "In Search of Frostmourne" to the tree, allowing the Scourge to trigger the Arthas (Valgarde) stuff without requiring Lordaeron to trigger it in their mission tree.
 - Arrival of Archimonde mission now enables the "Scourge Rebellion CB" allowing the Scourge to attack the Burning Legion in rebellion to their service.
 - Failure of Archimonde will now trigger either on the Hyjal event chain resolution, or if the Scourge attacks the Burning Legion with the "Scourge Rebellion" CB and obtains 60 warscore or more. 

# Flavour
- Added support for the Gorian Empire to have a unique form of the Old Horde government if they take control of the Old Horde faction.
- Switched the Hyjal Assault by Archimonde event chain to use the Burning Legion instead of the Demonic Vanguard tag. 

- Set the papal seat assigement to a dummy tag called Fel. This is to allow the Burning Legion to use the pope mechanics properly.
 - The Burning Legion will automatically claim the papal controller position from them after investing unholy influence.
- Burning Legion can now use the Fel 'pope' actions.
- Added +2 Unholy Influence to the Burning Legion government reform.
- Unholy Influence now grants a reduction to missionary maintenance cost based on the current amount held, capping at -100% at 200 points.
 
# Invasion
- Changed the Invasion mechanic slightly:
 - Removed the "Start Invasion" diplomatic action:
 - Added "Elemental Invasion" and "Demonic Invasion" casus belli.
  - The first siege won during wars with these casus belli will add a free core to the province.
  - You will only be able to have one invasion war at any one time.
 - If these casus belli are used, then the usage of the "Teleport Army" diplomatic action is free for one use.
 - Changed the Elemental estate privileges:
  - Overwhelming Force privilege now reduces the cooldown of Teleport Army to 30 days (365 by default)
  - Invasion Preparation privilege now removes the military power cost of Teleport Army.
  
# Burning Legion
- The Burning Legion now have an unique peace term: "Absorb into the Burning Legion"
 - This will convert the target to Fel and makes them a Demonic Vassal, which is a unique type of march.
- Changed Burning Legion/Demonic Order government:
 - Removed the Cossack buttons (fairly impotent and tied to the Demonic Host units)
 - Removed the Demonic Host special units (doesn't work well with the Teleport Army mechanic, which is central to the BL)
 - Added Raze Province mechanic.
  - Grants Devotion when used.
 - Adjusted the modifiers given by the reforms.
- Burning Legion loses devotion much quicker when at peace. This is to encourage razing (which restores devotion).
- Changed the following papal actions:
 - beckon_demonspawn -> global_manpower_modifier = 0.2
 - summon_eredar_warlocks -> missionaries = 2
 - consult_with_nathrezim -> culture_conversion_cost = -0.33
 - summon_succubi -> global_missionary_strength = 0.03
 - apply_demonic_wards -> defensiveness = 0.25

- Added the ability to switch the subject type between:
 - Vassal
 - March
 - Tributary Vassal
- Switching will cost ADM power and cause liberty desire to increase in the subject.

- Added the ability to 'invest' into a subject, providing powerful modifiers to the subject (and thus empowering you as an overlord). This is to promote a more decentralized playstyle where you can 'level up' your subjects.
