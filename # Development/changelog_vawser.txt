# Map

# Interface
- Changed the mana icon in the Magic menu to make it easier to see how much mana you have.

# Additions
- Added Twilight's Hammer events:
 - Twilight Infiltration in Silithus: adds cores, culture and religion in 4 random Silithus provinces. May occur 50 years after the Orcish Horde invasion.
 - Twilight Infiltration in Blackfathom Deeps: adds cores, culture and religion in the Blackfathom Deeps provinces. May occur 50 years after the Orcish Horde invasion.

 - Twilight Infiltration in PROVINCE: adds cores, culture and religion in a random province.

- Added "Prepare for Invasion" mission to the orc shared missions. Allows for the current Old Horde head to take the Dark Portal province without needing to take it in conquest.

# History
- Changed the history setup to work with the Orcish Horde system, i.e. the individual clans remain on Draenor, Orcish Horde represents them on Azeroth)
 - Exceptions made for the specific clans based on lore relevance, i.e. Frostwolf exile and move to Alterac Valley
- Adjusted the faction membership to better match each bookmark.
- Cleaned up the history for each bookmark.

# Gameplay
- Orcish Horde spawning now changes the clan that spawns it into the Orcish Horde tag first. This means the clan retains its Draenor holdings as the Orcish Horde.
- Faction Demands from the faction leader now add a opinion debuff to the faction members.

- Changed the Faction Roster demands: 
 - The Demand will now appear for each member, and they can decide on the amount to send (if any).
 - Sending nothing will add -25 opinion with the faction leader, whereas sending anything will add 25 opinion with the faction leader
 - Added new demands:
  - Demand Army Officers (Army Tradition)
  - Demand Navy Officers (Navy Tradition)
  - Demand Administrative Assistance (ADM)
  - Demand Diplomatic Assistance (DIP)
  - Demand Military Assistance (MIL)
  - Demand Loan (Trade Coalition only)

# Removal
- Removed the Beyond the Dark Portal and Frozen Throne bookmarks, as the other bookmarks cover the same period and supporting more than one bookmark for each major period is not needed.

# Bugfixes
- Fixed Twilight's Hammer spawning with Void religion instead of Twilight Cult.
- Fixed bug that meant the Old Horde roster wasn't made visible when the Old Horde is setup.
