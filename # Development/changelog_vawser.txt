# Additions
- Implemented new map additions:
 - South Sea islands
 - Seething Shore
 - Isle of Conquest
 - Strand of the Ancients
 - Paradise Isles
 - Timless Isle
 - Plunder Isle
 - Miscellaneous Islands
 - Dragon Isles
  - These start in Terra Incognita and act as the 'new world' for WWU.

- Added Monument Research system, replacing the general unlock all given by the Cultural Assimilation government reform.
 - Requires the Cultural Assimilation reform to appear.
 -  You can now choose to research the monuments on a specific 'continent'. 
 - Once begun, the research may invoke negative events. 
 - After 25 years, it will be complete and you will be able to use any monument on the chosen continent without needing to meet their normal requirements.
 
# Balance
- Reduced the land share hit taken when noble or religious rebels siege down a province.
 - Additionally, they only take land if they are disloyal when the siege occurs.
- Added +1 free leader slot for every 200 development.
- Monuments now require the province to be in a state before they will provide their modifiers.
- Changed the stat growth in the Spellcaster system to only use 5 tiers, the Improve X decisions will now always change the tier ranking when used.
 - Added an increasing cost for each improvement in a tier, and added a cooldown to usage so you can't immediately get to Legendary in all stats.

# Bugfixes
- Estate agenda now consider upgraded versions of buildings in the agenda that ask you to build certain buildings.
- Changed Spellcaster personality into "Spellcaster Capabilities" ruler modifier. This is to avoid instances where a ruler can have a full complement of personlities and then attempt to learn Spellcasting and have it fail to add the personality.
- Fixed a bug with the spellcasting stat gain decisions that meant they would never let you go beyond Poor skill.
