# Game Configuration
- Made the effect tooltips for the feature toggles clearer so the player can understand what each toggle does.

# Map
- Added 265 provinces to Draenor.
- Added 270 provinces to Outland.

# Collapse of Draenor
- Open Dimensional Portals decision is now available to non-Fel non-Orc nations on Draenor after year 650. This will make the Collapse of Draenor much more likely, and cause Outland to occur more often during playthroughs.
- The collapse itself now works differently. Instead of matching Draenor province ownership to Outland provinces, instead nations are given a set area(s) in Outland, and are compensated for their Draenor development with additional development in the new Outland provinces and a development bonus for 10, 30 or 60 years, the duration depending on the total development upon the collapse.

# Magic
- Added prompt to select Magic School upon ruler ascension if any of the automatic spellcaster reforms are present.
- The Magic Specialization menu now shows you all of the options and the requirements to unlock a school if the nation does not meet them.
