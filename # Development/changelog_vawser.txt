# Nation Spawning
- Changed how the setup events fire so they will always fire for the player if the player owns any of the affected provinces. 
- Added core only option to all of the setup events (costs 250 MIL) that only adds the cores.
- The "Tolerate" option now has logic to add fully in empty provinces, culture, religion and core in non-ROOT culture provinces, and core only in ROOT culture provinces.
