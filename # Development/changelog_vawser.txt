# Changelog

# Missions
- Added missions for Stromgarde
 
# Events
- Added 6 federation events for nations that use the Federation mechanic.
- Added new options to the Excavation events
- Added 3 new Excavation events

# Decisions
- Adjusted the naming for the Titan Isolation decisions.
 - Changed the Isolation effect to now block diplomatic actions instead of remove 2 diplomats
 - Added -10% Development Cost when in Isolation.

# Changes
- Adjusted the balance of a few MIL ideagroups to make the weaker ones more attractive.
- Capped Federation size based on leader development: 3 by default, 4 at 100 development, 5 at 200 development.
- Adjusted estate triggers so which are available for who makes more sense.
- Increased max estate privileges to 8.
- Removed the Patronize Guild estate action. The 4 estates it used to offer are now unlocked via random event.

- Limited the AI from picking the colonisation ideagroups after 6 nations have picked them.
- Seize Land interaction can now spawn rebels for each estate below 30 (instead of just one).
- Estate rebels are now unique to each estate. Losing to them will apply +20 influence for that estate for 10 years, take back 10 land, but will also restore 30 loyalty.
- Estate Coup is now easier to end, the uprising events are less common, and the rebels don't automatically win the provinces when spawned.
- Estate Coup now requires 95 influence in an estate to start
- Capped the Wants Your Provinces and Wants Subject Provinces debuffs to -25, to stop them messing up the intended diplomacy of the mod.
- Added 3 year cooldown to using each of the improve tax/production/manpower building actions.

# Bugfixes
