# Ruler Magic
- Changed how the Magic system works, and implemented a Custom GUI for it.
 - Aptitude now reduces the mana cost of spells (instead of unlocking the ability to use a spell).

- All rulers now have the following options within the Court View:
 - Magical Study (if untrained): this view will allow a ruler to start the process to become a spellcaster.
  - Costs 100 ADM, DIP and MIL to start (20 for spellcaster classes or Free Magic reform)
  - Each month between 0.1 and 1.0 Study Progress is added.
  - Once at 100% Study Progress, the ruler will become a spellcaster.
  - You can spend gold to boost Study Progress by 5. However the cost will double each time (up to x10). 
    This resets between each ruler.
 - Spellbook (if trained): this view will allow a ruler to cast their spells.
  - There are now a set of 10 general spells shared by all magic schools.
  - All magic schools now grant the spellcaster an additional 4 spells, unique to each school.
   
# Ruler Classes
- Changed how the Ruler Class system works, and implemented a Custom GUI for it.

- Each class now bestows 3 unique class abilities that can be used.
 - Each ability costs Energy, which functions similar to Mana from the Magic system.
 - There is a max of 5 stored Energy.

- All rulers now have the following options within the Court View:
 - Class Study (if untrained): this view will allow a ruler to start the process to become a specific class.
  - Costs 100 ADM, DIP and MIL to start (0 if you have wwu_administrative_ideas_7)
  - Each month between 0.1 and 1.0 Study Progress is added.
  - Once at 100% Study Progress, the ruler will become their chosen class.

   reaches 0 or there is no valid province to queue a building in.
