# Goods
- The price fluctuations of trade goods is now more controlled. A random good will be given a 'shortage' or 'surplus' price modifier, varying from +10% to +50% for Shortages, and -10% to -50% for Surplus. The modifier lasts for 3 years.

# Religion
- Added "Crystal" religion to the "Order" religion group: given to the Unbound.
 - Added 6 anglican actions.
 
# Bugfixes
- Various checks in the govenrment reforms for tags now always check was_tag, allowing you to switch to a new tag without losing the reform.
- Fixed the harmonization bonuses for Azeorthian and Draenorian religion groups.
- Developing subject provinces will no longer be limited to the 6/6/6 cap the AI is restricted by.
- Monument research decisions will now only show after the current research focus has finished. This prevents the player from accidently blocking the "Research Complete!" event by starting a new research focus before the event fires.
