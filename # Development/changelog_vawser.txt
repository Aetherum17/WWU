# Missions

 - The "Encounter the X" missions now apply a permanent local culture conversion cost reduction and development cost reduction to their respective regions.
- "Establish Foothold in Azeroth" mission will now give non-Fel orcs land in the Blasted Lands and reveal the Eastern Kingdoms to them.
 - The mission now requires the Draenor/Outland Dark Portal province to be 6/6/6 development (for the player).
 
# Religion
- Added new decisions for all religions that use Church Power. 
 - These decisions allow you to spend Church Power for a small bonus, giving more use to it once the initial bonuses have been purchased.

- Added "Centres of Fanaticism" for the following religions: C'Thun, N'Zoth, Yogg-Saron, Y'Shaarj, Sha, Twilight Cult, Nightmare, Decay, Void and Cult of the Damned.
 - Each of these has a decision that allows them to spawn a COF within a neighboring country that does not share their religion.
 - The religious rebels for these religions will also apply a COF when they win a siege.
 - A COF lasts for 5 years. During which, additional religious rebels of the associated type may spawn each month (5% chance per month) in neighboring provinces that do not share the associated religion.
 - If a COF province is converted away from the associated religion, the COF is removed immediately.
 
# Decisions
- Added "Hasten Portal Traversal" decision for the owner of the Dark Portal. Allows them to add a friendly movement speed buff to the Azeroth province, allowing for quick movement between Azeroth and Draenor.
 
# Great Projects
- Building the Dark Portal will reveal the Azeroth Dark Portal province immediately, and give it to the builder if it is empty.

# Map
- Native ferocity, hostility and size are now randomised within set bounds. This provides a more varied colonisation experience, whilst retaining local flavour, for example Plunder Isle natives are more numerous and hostile compared to Kalimdor natives.
 
# Bugfixes
- Hold events no longer occur if the nation cannot benefit from the hold.
- Fixed the Kul Tiran House Feud disaster from looping incorrectly.
- Being demoted from the leadership position of a Faction will restore the original government the nation had before they became the leader, instead of a generic one.
