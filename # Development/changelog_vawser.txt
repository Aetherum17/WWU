#--------------------------------------
# Game

- Feature Configuration covers:
 - Isolation mechanics
 - Federations
 - Racial modifiers
 - Magic mechanics
 - Archaeology mechanics
 - Alliance Restrictions (based on warcraft lore)
 
- Difficulty Configuration covers:
 - Vanquisher System

# Missions
- Added Kul Tiras mission tree.
- Added Burning Legion mission tree.

# Flavour
- Added support for the Gorian Empire to have a unique form of the Old Horde government if they take control of the Old Horde faction.

- Set the papal seat assigement to a dummy tag called Fel. This is to allow the Burning Legion to use the pope mechanics properly.
 - The Burning Legion will automatically claim the papal controller position from them after investing unholy influence.
- Burning Legion can now use the Fel 'pope' actions.
- Added +2 Unholy Influence to the Burning Legion government reform.
- Unholy Influence now grants a reduction to missionary maintenance cost based on the current amount held, capping at -100% at 200 points.
 
# Invasion
- Changed the Invasion mechanic slightly:
 - Removed the "Start Invasion" diplomatic action:
 - Added "Elemental Invasion" and "Demonic Invasion" casus belli.
  - The first siege won during wars with these casus belli will add a free core to the province.
  - You will only be able to have one invasion war at any one time.
 - If these casus belli are used, then the usage of the "Teleport Army" diplomatic action is free for one use.
 - Changed the Elemental estate privileges:
  - Overwhelming Force privilege now reduces the cooldown of Teleport Army to 30 days (365 by default)
  - Invasion Preparation privilege now removes the military power cost of Teleport Army.
  
# Burning Legion
- The Burning Legion now have an unique peace term: "Absorb into the Burning Legion"
 - This will convert the target to Fel and makes them a Demonic Vassal, which is a unique type of march.
- Changed Burning Legion/Demonic Order government:
 - Removed the Cossack buttons (fairly impotent and tied to the Demonic Host units)
 - Removed the Demonic Host special units (doesn't work well with the Teleport Army mechanic, which is central to the BL)
 - Added Raze Province mechanic.
  - Grants Devotion when used.
 - Adjusted the modifiers given by the reforms.
- Burning Legion loses devotion much quicker when at peace. This is to encourage razing (which restores devotion).
- Changed the following papal actions:
 - beckon_demonspawn -> global_manpower_modifier = 0.2
 - summon_eredar_warlocks -> missionaries = 2
 - consult_with_nathrezim -> culture_conversion_cost = -0.33
 - summon_succubi -> global_missionary_strength = 0.03
 - apply_demonic_wards -> defensiveness = 0.25
 - summon_doomguards -> infantry_power = 0.1
 - embolden_fire -> fire_damage = 0.1
 - venerate_demonic_effigies -> add_devotion = 10
 
# Balance
- Seize land now takes a different amount of land share from each estate.
- Mamluk government interactions:
 - Induce Innovation action is now called Traditional Advice, and grants -25% advisor cost for primary culture advisors.
 - Seeds of Tradition action now grants fewer ducats. (was 2 * primary culture dev, is now 1)
 - Military Tradition action is now called Cultural Militancy
 - Cultural Militancy action now grants less manpower. (was 50 * primary culture dev, is now 10)
- Increased the MTTH for the spellcaster stat degredation events.

# History
- Added alliance between Dark Iron and Firelands.

# Events
- Restricted some flavour events so they don't fire for more 'savage' countries, i.e. Burning Legion shouldn't get merchant complaint events.
