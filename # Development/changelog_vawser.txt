- Added "Faction Authority" mechanic to the "Trade Coalition" reform:

# Country Color
- Added country color selection to the Ruler View menu, allowing the player to change the country color to a set of predefined colors (they match the colors available in the Nation Designer).
 - This can also be done for subjects via the Subject Management menu.

# Diplomacy
- Call to War diplomatic action should be accepted more often.
- War Assist event should now more often cause the AI nation to accept the call to war.
- Added "Request Leadership" diplomatic action, allowing player faction members to take control of the faction from AI leaders if they have mutual 180 relations.

# Balance
- Relentless Conquest no longer works with Sow Terror/Coup de Grace, i.e. only the main province will be ceded, the others will simply be controlled as normal.

# Bugfix
- Loa estate nations now actually have a starting Loa influence set.
