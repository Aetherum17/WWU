 blood_knights.1.title: "Founding of the Blood Knights"
 blood_knights.1.desc: "After the Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas, many became disallusioned with the light. With the captive naaru M'uru returned to Silvermoon City thanks to Kael'thas, the magisters have experimented with ways of exploiting the light within. Eventually, it was decided to bound M'uru in the Hall of Blood, allowing for its light to be drawn from without the need of faith. And as such the Blood Knights were born."
