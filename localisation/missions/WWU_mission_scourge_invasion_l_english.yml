 wwu_kiljaedens_invasion_plan_desc: "Kil'Jaeden's plan to invade Azeroth revolves around the initial Scourge invasion of Lordaeron. The Scourge will gain strength overtaking the human and elf kingdoms in the area. Only a large and powerful undead force will be able to assault Dalaran so that Archimonde, Overlord of the Legion and brother to Kil'Jaeden, may be summoned to Azeroth Himself. Once summoned, Archimonde will head towards Mount Hyjal to destroy Nordrassil and set fire to Azeroth. Ner'Zhul sets his own plan into motion as well, thrusting Frostmourne from the Frozen Throne so that his chosen champion may claim it later."

We must protect these shipments while they are delivered to the unsuspecting human population. Be aware - the Lich King has foreseen an encounter with the young Paladin Prince Arthas Menethil. Kel'Thuzad will be killed by this ambitious boy, an event that will begin turning him towards more and more violence. In addition, this death will prepare Kel'Thuzad's soul for Lichdom at a later time. Ner'Zhul rewards his servants greatly."

'Whomsoever takes up this blade shall wield power eternal. Just as the blade rends flesh, so must power scar the spirit.'"
 
 wwu_frostmourne_hungers_title: "Frostmourne Hungers"
 wwu_frostmourne_hungers_desc: "'So, you've taken up Frostmourne at the expense of your comrades' lives, just as the Dark Lord said you would. You're stronger than I thought.' 'You waste your breath, Mal'Ganis. I heed only the voice of Frostmourne now.' 'You hear the voice of the Dark Lord. He whispers to you through the blade you wield. What does he say, young human? What does the Dark Lord of the Dead tell you now?' 'He tells me that the time for my vengeance has come.' - Final conversation between Mal'Ganis and Arthas as the Death Knight kills the Dreadlord."

 wwu_summon_archimonde_title: "Summon Archimonde"

 wwu_disaster_at_hyjal_desc: "Just as Ner'Zhul had hoped and planned, Archimonde has made a mistake. Malfurion Stormrage, Arch-Druid of the Moonglade has laid a trap at Nordrassil that will destroy Archimonde forever. The wisps in the surrounding area will overwhelm the demon Lord with nature magics, albeit at great cost to Nordrassil and the surrounding region. Once dead, the Legion forces across Azeroth will be disorganized. Kil'Jaeden, brother of Archimonde, will assume control of the Legion hereafter from Outland. With Archimonde dead, control of the Scourge armies will transfer back to Ner'Zhul."

 wwu_defend_the_frozen_throne_title: "Defend the Frozen Throne"
 wwu_defend_the_frozen_throne_desc: "Illidan has launched a surprise attack on the Frozen Throne! Using fel portals, He. his blood elf and naga forces have used portals to get to the base of Icecrown. Illidan plans to enter the Icecrown Citadel and personally destroy the Helm of Domination, and the Frozen Throne upon which Ner'Zhul sits. Arthas must rush to the side of his master if we are to avert this crisis. Fortunately, Anub'Arak of Azjol-Nerub has emerged to escort Arthas through the secret tunnels to Icecrown's base.

Ner'Zhul has risen from his station as an orc slave under Kil'Jaeden to that of a God. With Arthas' ascent of Icecrown, he will destroy the Frozen Throne upon which Ner'Zhul sits and place the Helm of Domination upon his head. Thereafter they will be One, and Ner'Zhul finally free. Let the world tremble before the Scourge!"
