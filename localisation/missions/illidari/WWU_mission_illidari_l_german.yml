 # --- Events ---
 wwu_mission_illidari.1.title: "Illidan's Trickery"
 wwu_mission_illidari.1.desc: "As Illidan rallied the forces of Outland under a new banner, a storm of fire and smoke descended upon the Black Temple, and Kil'jaeden appeared in all his unholy glory. Chastising Illidan for his foolhardy attempts to flee his wrath, Illidan quickly claimed that he had been gathering his forces for a second attack on the Frozen Throne. Kil'jaeden, seeing that Illidan's new comrades 'showed some promise', agreed to give Illidan one more chance to appease the demons.\n\nKil'jaeden did not realize Illidan's capture of the Black Temple was an act against the Legion itself. Demons were conniving creatures that were known to betray each other for greater power. Kil'jaeden thought Illidan to be his servant that had claimed Outland as a personal prize, which Kil'jaeden would allow him to keep if Illidan destroyed the Lich King. However, if Illidan refused, Kil'jaeden threatened to do everything in his power to retake the broken world from Illidan and destroy him. Illidan feigned his thoughts and allegiance before Kil'jaeden once more and agreed to destroy the Lich King."

 wwu_mission_illidari.2.title: "Assault the Frozen Throne"
 wwu_mission_illidari.2.desc: "Illidan, Vashj, and Kael'thas have begun to lay siege to Northrend, passing through the rift into the heart of Icecrown."
 wwu_mission_illidari.2.option.a: "Ner'zhul shall fall"
 
 wwu_mission_illidari.3.title: "Illidan's Assault"
 wwu_mission_illidari.3.desc: "Ner'zhul, knowing he would be overrun if he didn't do something, called Arthas to Northrend to complete the plan he had set in motion so many months before."
 wwu_mission_illidari.3.option.a: "Come Arthas, and serve your King"
 
 wwu_mission_illidari.10.title: "Failure in Icecrown"
 wwu_mission_illidari.10.desc: "Meeting Arthas at the glacier's base, the two warriors engaged in single combat. After a few minutes of exchanging blows, however, Arthas overcame Illidan's defenses and cut him down. Illidan fell in the snow, badly wounded. Rather than finish him off, Arthas, before taking his leave, warned Illidan to leave Azeroth and never return. After it became clear for Vashj and Kael that they could not destroy the Frozen Throne, they retreated, eventually back to Outland, taking Illidan with them."
 wwu_mission_illidari.10.option.a: "Alas, we shall turn our sights elsewhere"
 
 wwu_mission_illidari.11.title: "Victory in Icecrown"
 wwu_mission_illidari.11.desc: "Meeting Arthas at the glacier's base, the two warriors engaged in single combat. After a few minutes of exchanging blows, however, Illidan overcame Arthas's defenses and cut him down. Arthas fell in the snow, badly wounded. Rather than finish him off, Illidan, before taking his leave, warned Arthas that soon all of the Legion will fall, not merely Ner'zhul. With that, Lord Illidan left, returning back to Outland."
