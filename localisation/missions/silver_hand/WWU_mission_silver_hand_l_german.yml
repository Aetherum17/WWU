 wwu_mission_silver_hand.1.title: "The First Paladins"
 wwu_mission_silver_hand.1.desc: "Seeking to create an order that would suffer less attrition in battle, the Archbishop Alonsus Faol, who had recently learned everything that had transpired in Stormwind, including how the clerics had fared, met Anduin Lothar and offered him to create a new order that would represent the best qualities of humanity. An order that would include soldiers gifted not only in wielding the Light, but also possessing leadership qualities and mastering the arts of traditional warfare, while embodying the qualities of loyalty, bravery, and honor. With Lothar's consent, Alonsus Faol and Uther recruited noble knights and members of the priesthood from Lordaeron, so that the Archbishop can respectively train them in the ways of the Light and in martial combat as his apprentices. There was Turalyon, the priest who had helped forge the Alliance at the Council of Seven Nations. Then Saidan Dathrohan, a mountain of a man who was gifted with immense physical strength. Tirion Fordring, a knight renowned for his zeal and resilience. Uther, an accomplished knight and a pious believer who had already apprenticed under Faol for some years. And lastly Gavinrad the Dire, a battle-hardened knight from Stormwind, comrade of Lothar, who had fought in the First War. Faol welcomed his students with open arms, which he later named paladins, while the city of Stratholme would later serve as their base of operations."

 wwu_mission_silver_hand.9.desc: "After Arthas dismantled the Silver Hand, Alexandros Mograine organized a meeting with several other members of the Silver Hand in Southshore's inn, where he revealed the dark orb he kept after the Second War. With the efforts of Isillien, Fairbanks, Doan and Abbendis, he succeeded in purifying the artifact and decided that it would be forged into a weapon that would smite the Scourge.

The Light's aura around Uther grew blindingly bright as he prepared the killing blow, when suddenly the sword seemed to find its own way back into Arthas' hands and he was granted more power by the Lich King. The battle began to turn in Arthas's favor. Eventually, Uther, covered in blood from his wounds, fell to his knees and told Arthas he hoped there was a special place in hell waiting for him. Arthas replied that they may never know because he intended to live forever, then delivered the killing blow."

 wwu_mission_silver_hand.13.title: "The Ashbringer"
 wwu_mission_silver_hand.13.desc: "During the siege of Blackrock Spire in the Second War, Highlord Mograine of the Silver Hand witnessed an orcish warlock channeling magic through a dark orb. After the warlock's death, Mograine went to claim it for the Alliance, but his hand was badly mangled as soon as he touched it. Though describing the orb as the 'living embodiment of shadow', he was still curious as to what power it might hold and kept it in an iron chest. Mograine kept the orb a secret until the Scourge reached Lordaeron. He revealed it to several other members of the Silver Hand, suggesting that they search for the orb's polar opposite - a manifestation of the Holy Light itself - to be used against the impending undead holocaust. Mograine's peers, appalled at the sight of this dark crystal, attempted to destroy it with a holy spell. Unexpectedly, the crystal absorbed the spell and became its antithesis, the very crystal of pure light that Mograine suggested moments before, and even restored life to his mangled hand. It was decided that from this crystal a weapon would be forged that would smite the undead with such power that only a cloud of ash would remain in its wake, The Ashbringer!"
 wwu_mission_silver_hand.13.option.a: "Scourge stands no chance!"
 
 wwu_mission_silver_hand.14.title: "Death of Alexandros Mograine"
 wwu_mission_silver_hand.14.desc: "After the assault at Stratholme we did not hear any news from our lord Alexandros and High Inquisitor Fairbanks. After some days Fairbanks returned with some bad news. Our leader Alexandros Mograine, the Ashbringer, was bested in battle and killed from the undead. He was one of the founding members of the Silver Hand and his death will be a huge hit to the cause. Lord Dathrohan revealed to us that Fairbanks has been corrupted by undeath so we removed the threat. An other hero lost because of the Scourge..."
 wwu_mission_silver_hand.14.option.a: "We need to move forward without them..."
 
 wwu_mission_silver_hand.15.title: "Question: The Order's Composition"
 wwu_mission_silver_hand.15.desc:  "After heated discussions about the future of the Order, we fell upon the issue of Silver Hand's army composition. Some knights support a multicultural order as it was since the birth of the Alliance, while others declare the other races as unclean and support a purely Human order. What we will do?"
