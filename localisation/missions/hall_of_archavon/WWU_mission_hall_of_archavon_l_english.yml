 wwu_archavon.1.title: "Titans Facility"
 wwu_archavon.1.desc: "Deep within the icy stronghold of Wintergrasp lies the Vault of Archavon, an ancient Titan repository protected by colossal Watchers—Stone, Storm, Flame, and Ice. According to legend, these guardians exist to defend treasures of the Titans and may unleash their fury upon any who threaten the Vault. The Watchers cannot remain idle. Without continual development and sharpening of their strengths, the Vault’s defences will falter under the pressures of future wars. Titan forges hush only to fuel complacency."
 wwu_archavon.1.op1: "These giants will be refined."
 
 wwu_archavon.3.title: "The Giants Awakening"
 wwu_archavon.3.desc: "Though forged by the Titans to stand eternally vigilant, even the mightiest Watchers must adapt to changing threats. Deep within the frozen vault, the great elemental giants—Archavon, Emalon, Koralon, and Toravon—submit themselves to ancient combat drills, ritual reforging, and arcane enhancement. The ground quakes beneath their training. Storm surges, firestorms, and glacial bursts echo through the halls as each Guardian sharpens their elemental dominion. Under the silent guidance of the Vault’s arcane mechanisms, they are not simply defenders—they are evolving weapons of Titan design. To leave the Watchers idle is to invite ruin. Their strength must grow if the legacy of the Titans is to endure."

 wwu_archavon.2.desc: "The Vault trembled.\nNo longer content with silent guard duty, the mighty Watchers—Archavon of Stone, Emalon of Storm, Koralon of Flame, and Toravon of Ice—have awakened and marched to war. Their titanic forms blot out the sun as they descend upon the battlefield, elemental fury erupting with every step. Enemy ranks shatter before them. Walls crumble. Fire, frost, lightning, and earth tear through mortal armies with divine judgment. The Titans wrath has been made manifest."
