 wwu_mission_vrykul_shared.1.desc: "Like every few years, we once more gather to prepare for a new game. A great hunt, a proving ground for vrykul men and women alike. One thing that proves bravery and resiliance. Thing that seperates mighty from fragile, alive and dead."

 wwu_mission_vrykul_shared.3.title: "The Advanced Hunt"
 wwu_mission_vrykul_shared.3.desc: "This year, we decided to not play around. Finally, true hunters can show what they are really capeable of. This time, the hunt will bring glory and fame.

 wwu_mission_vrykul_shared.4.desc: "This year, we decided to challenge the fate. At long last, the hunt few return from. This time, the risk is high. We challenge the very titans of Northrend, the mightiest of them all. What will happen today, will be written down, for the next generation to spreak, a legend of true warriros. Today, we challenge the Mammoths of the Frozen North, the Jormungal Worms that rule the frozen tundra and the oldest among them, the Proto-Drakes!"
 wwu_mission_vrykul_shared.4.option.a: "Let the hunt begin!"
