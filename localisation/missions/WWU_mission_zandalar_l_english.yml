Additionally, buried on the island by a great cataclysm caused by the eruption of the well of eternity, the Zandalari lost its position to the younger races, burying itself in decadence. The policy of our King Rastakhan does not indicate that anything will change in this matter. The radicalist and patriot §YProphet Zul§!, bored with the passivity of our king, will try to repair the country on his own. Our main goal is to get our kingdom back on track, with Zandalari becoming an empire again not only in name."

It is a cursed place, ruled over by Pirate-King Zem'lan and his crew of the eternal damned. In ages past, the port was attacked by the Faithless sethrak. Pirate-King Zem'lan refused to allow Zandalari refugees onto his ships to escape the sethrak attack and ordered his crew to rally and defend the port with their lives. However, when it became clear that the sethrak were too many, Zem'lan instead gathered his crew on the Golden Isle and conducted a ritual with three magical idols to curse his crew into undead skeletons, forced to serve him for eternity."
