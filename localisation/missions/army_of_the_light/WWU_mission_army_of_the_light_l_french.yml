 wwu_army_of_the_light.100.title: "Fall of Antorus, the Burning Throne"
 wwu_army_of_the_light.100.desc: "Upon years of corruption, Anotorus, the mightiest of the Legion's Strongholds in Argus, stood as a monument of darkness, trying to destroy all that exist in the universe. That was, until today, when Army of the Light stormed the gates of the citadel, sweaping it clean of any demon on their path. With the massive bombardment, they greatly damaged the temple, making it crumble to dust and ruins. The Burning Legion had lost their seat of power, their leaders slain within its grounds, impacting the unity of the great burning crusade. Argus, their base of operation, soon will be swept of any demonkind remaining."
