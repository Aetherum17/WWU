 wwu_nazmir.1.title: "First Blood Matron"
 wwu_nazmir.1.desc: "In the shadowed groves of Nazmir, the blood moon rises, marking the time of choosing. From the depths of the swamps, a new leader emerges, chosen by the whispers of G'huun.[ROOT.Monarch.GetName], the Blood Matron, now destined to lead her kin in a sacred quest. Her vision is clear - to awaken G'huun and bring about the fall of the Zandalari's Golden Throne. The drums of war beat in the hearts of the Blood Trolls, echoing her call to arms. It's time to consolidate power and unite the Nazmir region. Will the world tremble before their might?"
 wwu_nazmir.1.op1: "Let's start worshiping G'huun"
 
 wwu_nazmir.2.title: "Sacrificial Altar"
 wwu_nazmir.2.desc: "Deep in the swamps, the blood troll village of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is terrifying. A sacrificial altar was built in its heart, a place of dark rituals and bloody offerings to G'huun.\nG'huun's followers, the blood trolls, prepare for a ceremony that will bring them the power and favor of their cruel god. Enemies of the cult, caught in constant conflict, are to be sacrificed so that their screams and suffering may be a tribute to G'huun. But it's not just the enemies that will be sacrificed; also the men of the tribe will have the "honor" to join their opponents on the altar."
 wwu_nazmir.2.op1: "Bring the victims!"
 
 # --- Fungarians Events ---
 wwu_nazmir_fungarian_invasion.10.title: "Fungarians uprising!"
 wwu_nazmir_fungarian_invasion.10.desc: "Fungarians, a unique race of sentient mushroom people, inhabit the same marshy lands. Their fungal society thrives amidst the damp foliage, but the arrival of the blood trolls has disrupted their peaceful existence. The Fungarian spore warriors—swift, silent, and deadly—ambush blood troll patrols. They sabotage voodoo rituals, disrupt supply lines, and free captive Fungarians"
 wwu_nazmir_fungarian_invasion.10.option.a: "Make mushroom soup out of them"

 wwu_nazmir_fungarian_invasion.11.title: "Victory over the Fungarians"
 wwu_nazmir_fungarian_invasion.11.desc: "The blood trolls adapted their tactics. They set traps in the marshes, ensnaring unsuspecting Fungarian scouts. Many Fungarians fled deeper into the swamp, seeking refuge in hidden caverns and hollowed-out tree trunks. Their once-proud society fractured, and hope dwindled like a dying ember."
 wwu_nazmir_fungarian_invasion.11.option.a: "Put them to work!"

 wwu_nazmir_fungarian_invasion.12.title: "Defeat against Fungarians"
 wwu_nazmir_fungarian_invasion.12.desc: "The Fungarians tapped into their unique fungal abilities. Their mycelial networks connected every spore warrior, allowing them to share thoughts, strategies, and even memories. As one, they coordinated attacks and outmaneuvered the blood trolls. As the blood trolls retreated, the swamp responded. Fungal blooms erupted, painting the landscape in vibrant hues. Bioluminescent mushrooms carpeted the ground, and the air hummed with life."
 wwu_nazmir_fungarian_invasion.12.option.a: "Where's our soup?"
