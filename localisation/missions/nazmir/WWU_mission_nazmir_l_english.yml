 wwu_nazmir.1.title: "First Blood Matron"
 wwu_nazmir.1.desc: "In the shadowed groves of Nazmir, the blood moon rises, marking the time of choosing. From the depths of the swamps, a new leader emerges, chosen by the whispers of G'huun.[ROOT.Monarch.GetName], the Blood Matron, now destined to lead her kin in a sacred quest. Her vision is clear - to awaken G'huun and bring about the fall of the Zandalari's Golden Throne. The drums of war beat in the hearts of the Blood Trolls, echoing her call to arms. It's time to consolidate power and unite the Nazmir region. Will the world tremble before their might?"

 wwu_nazmir.2.title: "Sacrificial Altar"
 wwu_nazmir.2.desc: "Deep in the swamps, the blood troll village of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is terrifying. A sacrificial altar was built in its heart, a place of dark rituals and bloody offerings to G'huun.\nG'huun's followers, the blood trolls, prepare for a ceremony that will bring them the power and favor of their cruel god. Enemies of the cult, caught in constant conflict, are to be sacrificed so that their screams and suffering may be a tribute to G'huun. But it's not just the enemies that will be sacrificed; also the men of the tribe will have the "honor" to join their opponents on the altar."

 wwu_nazmir.3.title: "Fate of Fungarians"
 wwu_nazmir.3.desc: "Exhausted and defeated, the Fungarians await imminent judgment from the bloodthirsty trolls. Their former abodes, once full of life, now lie in ruins. The Fungarians have died in battle. Their warriors, wounded and weary, sit in a circle, awaiting the bloody trolls. Their eyes show fear and resignation. The bloody trolls approach, their bodies covered with bloody marks. They invoke dark powers, and their eyes glow ominously. Judgment is imminent."
 wwu_nazmir.3.op1: "To the mushroom plantations!"
 wwu_nazmir.3.op2: "Give them autonomy"

 wwu_nazmir.5.title: "Method of extracting raw materials"
 wwu_nazmir.5.desc: "Along with the change in method, the speed of resource extraction will change. Let's keep this in mind, maybe it is better to pay more now to have more benefits later?"
 wwu_nazmir.5.op1: "Advanced method"
 wwu_nazmir.5.op2: "Normal method"

 wwu_nazmir.6.title: "Trade good in the province"
 wwu_nazmir.6.desc: "Deep within the heart of Nazmir, the blood trolls find themselves at a crossroads. Their once-abundant province harbors a wealth of resources, but they grapple with uncertainty over which path to take. Gathered around a moss-covered council stone, the Blood Martron debate her options with elders."

 wwu_nazmir.7.title: "Blood Cycle"
 wwu_nazmir.7.desc: "In the dark depths of the Nazmir forests, the blood trolls pay homage to their mighty deity, G'huun. With each Blood Cycle, the trolls gather at an ancient temple where the altar is covered in dry earth and charred bones. Under the veil of night, when stars illuminate the sky, the ritual begins. The blood trolls bring their offerings: freshly harvested hearts of men, blood from wounds, and sometimes even their own fingers. They believe that their suffering and bloody tributes strengthen Ghuun. In return, they seek his favor and protection against enemies."

 wwu_nazmir.10.title: "Old God gift"
 wwu_nazmir.10.desc: "The air crackled with forbidden magic, and the matron felt her veins surge with power. She did not die; instead, her aging body rejuvenated. Her skin tightened, and her eyes glowed with an otherworldly light. G’thun had granted her immortality—the ultimate reward for her unwavering devotion. The matron’s newfound eternity came at a cost: she would forever witness the suffering of her people, the endless flow of blood, and the twisted machinations of her god. But she would endure. For now, she was immortal — a living relic of the troll civilization, forever bound to the dark rites of G’thun."
 wwu_nazmir.10.op1: "Accept the gift"
 wwu_nazmir.10.op1: "Reject the gift"

 wwu_nazmir.11.title: "Ben Ten"
 wwu_nazmir.11.desc: ""
 wwu_nazmir.11.op1: "Yes!"

 wwu_nazmir.12.title: "The Fall of the Immortal Matron"
 wwu_nazmir.12.desc: "The immortal matron grew weary. The once fervent blood rituals now felt like mundane chores. She no longer reveled in the crimson cascade or the intoxicating scent of sacrifice. Her heart had dulled, and her devotion waned. G’thun, the malevolent god, watched from his realm. His patience wore thin. The matron’s negligence angered him. She had become complacent, forsaking her duty. The blood flow dwindled, and the deity hungered for more. One moonless night, as the matron prepared for the ritual, she hesitated. The sacrificial blade trembled in her hand. She wondered if there was more to existence than endless slaughter. Perhaps she could find solace beyond the altar. In that moment of doubt, G’thun struck. His wrath echoed through the forest, shaking the ancient trees. The matron’s immortality shattered like glass. She gasped, feeling her life force drain away. The connection severed, she collapsed, mortal once more. The god’s voice echoed in her mind: “You betrayed me, matron. Your slothful heart led to your downfall.” The matron’s body convulsed, pain searing through her veins. She glimpsed her own mortality — the frailty of flesh and bone. G’thuna’s curse consumed her, and she crumpled to the forest floor, gasping her last breath. And so, the once-immortal matron became a cautionary tale—a reminder that even gods demand unwavering devotion. Her name faded into legend, whispered by trolls around campfires. The blood rituals continued, but the matron’s legacy was one of failure and broken promises."
 wwu_nazmir.12.op1: "Everything has its price"

 # --- Fungarians Events ---
 wwu_nazmir_fungarian_invasion.10.title: "Fungarians uprising!"
 wwu_nazmir_fungarian_invasion.10.desc: "Fungarians, a unique race of sentient mushroom people, inhabit the same marshy lands. Their fungal society thrives amidst the damp foliage, but the arrival of the blood trolls has disrupted their peaceful existence. The Fungarian spore warriors—swift, silent, and deadly—ambush blood troll patrols. They sabotage voodoo rituals, disrupt supply lines, and free captive Fungarians"
 wwu_nazmir_fungarian_invasion.10.option.a: "Make mushroom soup out of them"

 wwu_nazmir_fungarian_invasion.11.title: "Victory over the Fungarians"
 wwu_nazmir_fungarian_invasion.11.desc: "The blood trolls adapted their tactics. They set traps in the marshes, ensnaring unsuspecting Fungarian scouts. Many Fungarians fled deeper into the swamp, seeking refuge in hidden caverns and hollowed-out tree trunks. Their once-proud society fractured, and hope dwindled like a dying ember."
 wwu_nazmir_fungarian_invasion.11.option.a: "Put them to work!"

 wwu_nazmir_fungarian_invasion.12.title: "Defeat against Fungarians"
 wwu_nazmir_fungarian_invasion.12.desc: "The Fungarians tapped into their unique fungal abilities. Their mycelial networks connected every spore warrior, allowing them to share thoughts, strategies, and even memories. As one, they coordinated attacks and outmaneuvered the blood trolls. As the blood trolls retreated, the swamp responded. Fungal blooms erupted, painting the landscape in vibrant hues. Bioluminescent mushrooms carpeted the ground, and the air hummed with life."
 wwu_nazmir_fungarian_invasion.12.option.a: "Where's our soup?"
