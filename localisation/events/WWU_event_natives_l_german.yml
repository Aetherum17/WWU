 wwu_natives.1.title: "[Root.NativeCulture.GetName] People Enter Our Colony"
 wwu_natives.1.desc: "As our colony in [Root.GetName] has continued to grow and develop, we have begun to encroach on the territory belonging to a people referring to themselves as the “[Root.NativeCulture.GetName]”. They send jeers and insults in their native tongue, and have even started raiding our settlements. One of our own men with a sympathy for these savages has learned the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] language and he tells us that they are claiming our colony in [Root.GetName] is encroaching on their ancestral land. Apparently they demand that we grant them concessions, or war will be inevitable."
 wwu_natives.1.option.a: "Erase these savages from [Root.GetName]!"
 wwu_natives.1.option.b: "Just pay them to stop hissing at us."
 wwu_natives.1.option.c: "Offer them whatever they desire, we should live in peace."
 
 wwu_natives.2.title: "[Root.NativeCulture.GetName] Raids on Our Colonies"
 wwu_natives.2.desc: "The [Root.Culture.GetName] settlers in [Root.GetName] are merely attempting to bring civilization to the savage lands of [Root.GetSuperRegionName] and enlighten it with superior [Root.Culture.GetGroupName] culture. However, it seems that the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] savages refuse to accept our superior ways, and our harsh treatment of these native people has only served to increase tensions between the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] tribesmen and our colonists. The only question now is how do we resolve this situation?"
 wwu_natives.2.option.a: "We end it with a show of force!"
 wwu_natives.2.option.b: "The situation can’t be salvaged, abandon the colony."
 
 wwu_natives.3.title: "[Root.NativeCulture.GetName] People Plead for Aid"
 wwu_natives.3.desc: "It seems our harsh treatment of the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] people living in and around our colonies have had quite the adverse effect on their continued existence. A combination of the foreign diseases our colonists brought over both intentionally and unintentionally has devastated the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] populace living in [Root.GetName] and now their leaders have approached us begging us to relent and take pity on the suffering of their people."
 wwu_natives.3.option.a: "These savages haven’t known true suffering yet."
 wwu_natives.3.option.b: "Perhaps we should show charity this once."
 
 wwu_natives.4.title: "Colonial Expansion"
 wwu_natives.4.desc: "It would seem that our harsh treatment of the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] people living in [Root.GetName] has paid off in a massive way. Forcing those primitives off of their rich fertile soil has created new opportunities for [Root.Culture.GetName] settlers to take their place and our colonial companies have already begun exploiting the ancestral land of the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName], but they request financial aid to complete the construction of the new settlement."
 wwu_natives.4.option.a: "For glory, God, and gold!"
 wwu_natives.4.option.b: "It's too expensive."
 
 wwu_natives.5.title: "Lucrative Trade Agreements With the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] Tribe"
 wwu_natives.5.desc: "Lesser nations question what value there is in engaging the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] people in trade, but our merchants know better. It seems that these people do not know the true value of what they hold, and we have a golden opportunity to strike riches from these people by taking massive stores of valuable goods and metals in exchange for some relatively trivial medical resources."
 wwu_natives.5.option.a: "Make the deal!"
 wwu_natives.5.option.b: "Make an investment in their tribe."
 wwu_natives.5.option.c: "We will not exploit these people."
 
 wwu_natives.6.title: "[Root.NativeCulture.GetName] People Request Aid"
 wwu_natives.6.desc: "It seems that the trading between our colonists in [Root.GetName] and the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] has led to an outbreak of diseases usually foreign to [Root.GetSuperRegionName]. They come to us with grizzly stories of bringing goods traded from our nation back to their tribe, only for it to infect their weak and elderly with a plethora of diseases their healers have never encountered before. All they ask is for a single free shipment of medical supplies, and they will gladly begin integrating with our colony."
 wwu_natives.6.option.a: "Can the treasury bear such an expense?"
 wwu_natives.6.option.b: "Give them everything they need and more!"
 
 wwu_natives.7.title: "[Root.NativeCulture.GetName] People Request [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] Conversion!"
 wwu_natives.7.desc: "Although we have not been actively propagating our religion in [Root.GetName], many members of the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] tribe have been adopting the [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] religion regardless and request to officially abandon their old faith in favor of ours and join our colony. We could take this offer and apply it to the entire [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] tribe living close to our colony in [Root.GetName], but this may anger some of the more traditional [Root.OriginalReligion.GetName] members of their tribe."
 wwu_natives.7.option.a: "Welcome to the faith!"
 wwu_natives.7.option.b: "A good [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] allows [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] people their ways."
 
 wwu_natives.8.title: "The Suffering of the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] People"
 wwu_natives.8.desc: "To our horror, we have discovered that our mere presence in [Root.GetName] is causing massive damage to the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] people! We have always strived to coexist with native people, but just glancing at the effect that foreign diseases have had on the local [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] villages is more than anyone can bear. The suffering of their people cannot be ignored, and if we do nothing then we risk bringing an end to the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] people…"
 wwu_natives.8.option.a: "We simply can't afford it."
 wwu_natives.8.option.b: "Give them everything they need!"
 
 wwu_natives.9.title: "Natives in [Root.GetName] Adopt [Root.Owner.Culture.GetName] Culture"
 wwu_natives.9.desc: "To our surprise, many members of the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] tribe have chosen to adopt our language and etiquette and have integrated themselves into the [Root.GetName] colony! These people are now considered another component of the unique cultural melting pot in [Root.GetName]."
 wwu_natives.9.option.a: "They’re going to love being [Root.Owner.Culture.GetName]!"
 
 wwu_natives.10.title: "Accommodation with Natives in $PROVINCENAME$"
 wwu_natives.10.desc: "Though there have been troubles in our relations with the native people of [Root.GetName], we have managed to find an agreement with the ruling class of their tribe, and this should lead to a massive reduction in violence and conflict between our two people. We have broken bread with their leaders and jointly agreed to cease our conflict and move forward as friends and allies!"
 wwu_natives.10.option.a: "Peace!"
