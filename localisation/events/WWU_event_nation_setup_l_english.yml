 wwu_setup_outland.1.title: "Collapse of Draenor"
 wwu_setup_outland.1.desc: "As the Alliance push forth into Draenor, the elder shaman Ner'zhul is attempting to allow the remaining orcs on Draenor to escape to other worlds by opening other dimensional portals. The presence of so many portals has begun to split the planet apart, launching torn fragments of Draenor towards the Twisting Nether. Most life on Draenor has been wiped out in the explosion, and the surviving continent was drastically reshaped; most of the remaining wildlife became sickly or corrupt. Due to the planet's destruction, the barriers between Draenor and the Twisting Nether collapsed, and the shredded reality left open paths to all various corners of the cosmos."
