 wwu_outland_exodus.1.title: "The Uneasy Alliance"
 wwu_outland_exodus.1.desc: "By the time of the Third War, Garithos has risen to the rank of Grand Marshal, promoted not necessarily due to his own abilities, but by his father's reputation and title. He was the highest-ranking survivor of Lordaeron's military after the Scourge's rampage across Lordaeron, and he recruited what forces he could muster from both volunteers and conscripted civilians.\n\nThe healthiest blood elves led by Kael'thas Sunstrider, prince of the ruined Quel'Thalas, also joined his army. Garithos did not enjoy having to work with the blood elves or dwarves, believing that the Alliance's mission should be to preserve humanity above all else and that the Alliance should never have accepted the elves in the first place."
 wwu_outland_exodus.1.option.a: "If we must..."
 
 wwu_outland_exodus.2.title: "Garithos's Betrayal"
 wwu_outland_exodus.2.desc: "While they were in Dalaran, Garithos' scouting parties discovered a large undead strike force advancing through Silverpine Forest to attempt to retake Dalaran. Before Garithos left to push back the advancing Scourge from the south, he informed Kael'thas that he and his brethren would not accompany them on the front lines. Instead, they would be tasked with fixing the nearby observatories to watch for Scourge flanks from the west, much to Kael's dismay.\n\nThe observatories repaired by the Alliance Remnants discovered that an undead strike force was coming from the west. Garithos returned to the front and left Kael'thas awaiting orders. Then, an Emissary sent by Garithos informed Kael'thas that he had to engage the strike force from the west, but also recalled all foot soldiers, cavalry and support teams to the front, leaving Kael with only his blood elven troops. Garithos had hoped that the elves would fall before the Scourge, and no longer be his problem; the missions given to Kael's greatly reduced force were intended to be suicidal, impossible for the elves to complete."
