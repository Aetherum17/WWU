However, this would mean committing our soldiers to war and possibly losing them. The king's skepticism contrasts with Godfrey's arguments in favor of integrating into the military Alliance, both to preserve our diplomatic and trade relations and to remain in good standing with its members. On the other hand, the king is confident that he can contain the Horde on his own, should the threat ever loom over the kingdom."

Tensions escalated as the rebels sought to overthrow the monarchy and take control of the northern regions of Gilneas.

As the time has come to decide his fate, the people and leaders of Gilneas are divided on how to handle the former traitor. Should he be punished for his betrayal and the suffering he caused, or should the kingdom move past his transgressions and focus on healing and unity?
