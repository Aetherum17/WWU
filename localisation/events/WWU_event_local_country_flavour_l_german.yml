 wwu_local_country_flavour.25.desc: "The [Root.GetNobilityName] often prove unruly subjects of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], seeking to resist any infringement on their autonomy and seizing any opportunity to strengthen their position. This often includes making common cause with foreign powers.

Recently, one of these rivalries boiled over into outright conflict as [Root.assassinated_dude.GetName], the leader of a powerful noble house, was assassinated by his rivals.

 wwu_local_country_flavour.27.title: "Sale of Offices"
 wwu_local_country_flavour.27.desc: "The crown often resorted to short term cash grabs like the sale of government offices. These sales would bring in a lot of revenue but in the long term, more officials meant more tax revenue siphoned off before it reached the royal treasury."

 wwu_local_country_flavour.28.desc: "The realm often grants trading companies the exclusive rights to traffic goods in a region in exchange for a lump-sum payment and continuing revenues from the traders.

 wwu_local_country_flavour.29.desc: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has to employ many methods to keep the unruly nobles in line. One of the most common is cold hard cash. We already grant the nobles a pension in exchange for relinquishing certain rights; however, their leaders now claim that we are not paying them enough and are demanding their pensions rise if they are to continue to support the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 wwu_local_country_flavour.29.option.a: "Accept their demands."
 wwu_local_country_flavour.29.option.b: "Refuse their demands."

 wwu_local_country_flavour.30.title: "Grant Export Licenses"
 wwu_local_country_flavour.30.desc: "Instead of paying cash to the nobles, another option is to grant them privileges to collect special revenues, for example from foreign trade, from which they can make a healthy profit. A proposal has recently reached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s ears to grant several noble families export licenses for our trade with our neighbor. Doing so would please them greatly, but the commercial classes may view the matter less favorably..."

 wwu_local_country_flavour.32.option.a: "Accept demands"
 wwu_local_country_flavour.32.option.b: "Reject demands"

 wwu_local_country_flavour.33.title: "Cities Demand Old Rights"
 wwu_local_country_flavour.33.desc: "As we look to centralize the state, we inevitably infringe on the autonomy of the urban dwellers, who have always existed under a different code of rules than their rural brethren. The cities actively resist pressure to be brought under more uniform rules and regulations, and demand that their old rights be respected."
 wwu_local_country_flavour.33.option.a: "Deny them their old rights!"

 wwu_local_country_flavour.33.option.c: "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will handle it."
 
 wwu_local_country_flavour.34.title: "Non-enforcement of Ordinances"
 wwu_local_country_flavour.34.desc: "Although the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] issues many ordinances, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is in practice almost powerless to enforce them. Instead, enforcement depends upon the local powers - regional nobility and city governments - that are not always as vigilant as would be desired. Recently, it has come to our attention that our authorities in [troublesome_province.GetAreaName] are being particularly reticent in enforcing the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s will."
 wwu_local_country_flavour.34.option.a: "Let them handle it."
 wwu_local_country_flavour.34.option.b: "Increase attempts!"
 wwu_local_country_flavour.34.option.c: "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will handle it."
 
 wwu_local_country_flavour.35.title: "The [Root.GetTradersName] Request Privileges"
 wwu_local_country_flavour.35.desc: "The [Root.GetTradersName] have grown increasingly resentful of the power of the noble families and particularly their lack of opportunities in the higher ranks of government. Their only route into power is to marry into poor but well-titled noble families, or to pry open positions in government circles by demanding greater privileges from the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency]."
 wwu_local_country_flavour.35.option.a: "Grant them privileges."
 wwu_local_country_flavour.35.option.b: "Deny them privileges."

 wwu_local_country_flavour.36.title: "Build a Great Palace"
 wwu_local_country_flavour.36.desc: "Monarchs often struggling to subdue the nobility and secure their standing in the eyes of their peers. The rise of firearms has reduced the nobles' role as warriors but left them with, in the eyes of the monarchs, too much idle time. In order to dazzle the nobles and keep them occupied, many monarchs are increasingly creating grand new palaces and introducing elaborate court rituals. [Root.GetUsableNameCap] is no different, and we have instructed our chief architect to draw up plans for a new palace to be built."
 wwu_local_country_flavour.36.option.a: "Build the palace."

 wwu_local_country_flavour.37.title: "Uncooperative Philosopher"
 wwu_local_country_flavour.37.desc: "The philosopher [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] has not shied back from expressing opinions contrary to those of both the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency] and the Holy Church. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHisCap] latest publications appear to have been particularly provocative, so much so that the Church is demanding we hand [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHim] over to their inquisitors to be tried for heresy and 'persuaded' to recant. Denying the them this would anger the Church greatly, but [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] has many supporters among the [Root.GetAdjective] intelligentsia."
 wwu_local_country_flavour.37.option.a: "Imprison $PHILOSOPHER_O_PRONOUN$."
 wwu_local_country_flavour.37.option.b: "Allow $PHILOSOPHER_O_PRONOUN$ to remain free."

 wwu_local_country_flavour.38.desc: "Our merchants have long complained about the unfair treatment they have suffered in [harassing_merchants_nation.GetUsableName]. Recently, however, these complaints have escalated and the merchants now claim to be victims of [harassing_merchants_nation.GetAdjective] brigandage and privateering - attacks they insist were carried out with the tacit support of the [harassing_merchants_nation.GetAdjective] [harassing_merchants_nation.GetRulerTitleOrRegency]. We must find a solution to the issue, one way or another."
 wwu_local_country_flavour.38.option.a: "Escalate complaint."

They have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to ask for help, hoping that their distant kinship with the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family and their promises of undying support will sway [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to help them out in their time of need."
