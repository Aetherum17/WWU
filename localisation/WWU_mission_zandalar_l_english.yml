 wwu_zandalar.3.title: "Rise of the King of the Jungle"
 wwu_zandalar.3.desc: "The Isle of Giants, like the un'goro crater, is a place frozen in time. The animals living here are different from those on the entire planet. The mighty Devilsaurs are the target of Zandalar, beasts whose appearance and size are able to sow fear in the enemy. We can join our army immediately, these mighty creatures. We can also use the power of Loa to start experimenting and as a result create a war machine that is half a demigod of Loa, but it will not be so easy"
 wwu_zandalar.3.op1: "We have no time or resources for experiments"
 wwu_zandalar.3.op2: "Let's start the experiments"

 wwu_zandalar.4.title: "Growth of Oondasta"
 wwu_zandalar.4.desc: "Our half-Loa research is progressing, but we need funding and people to continue it. We should continue to fund research to be able to use this war machine faster."
 wwu_zandalar.4.op1: "Let's pay for further research"

 wwu_zandalar.6.title: "Fightings on the Island of Giants"
 wwu_zandalar.6.desc: "The Oondasta show a desire to fight for island dominance with other devilsaurs. The experience that can be gained in such fights can effectively accelerate its development. However, there is a risk of his injury or, worse, his death. Should we take that risk?"
 wwu_zandalar.6.op1: "Let him show his domination"
 wwu_zandalar.6.op2: "We cannot allow it"
 
 wwu_zandalar.7.title: "Oondasta is ready to put on armor"
 wwu_zandalar.7.desc: "Oondasta's power is not equal to Loa, but it has strengthened him to the point where he can be safely called half-Loa. As a war machine, we will put on a suitable armor that will support him in future fights."

 wwu_zandalar.11.desc: "Once the great strength and heart of the Zul Empire that led all trolls. Today only a shadow of myself. Additionally, buried on the island by a great cataclysm caused by the eruption of the well of eternity, the Zandalari lost its position to the younger races, burying itself in decadence. The policy of our King Rastakhan does not indicate that anything will change in this matter. The radicalist and patriot §YProphet Zul§!, bored with the passivity of our king, will try to repair the country on his own. Our main goal is to get our kingdom back on track, with Zandalari becoming an empire again not only in name."
 wwu_zandalar.11.op1: "Let the changes bring us enlightenment"
 
 wwu_zandalar.12.title: "End of The Rusty Empire"
 wwu_zandalar.12.desc: "The changes we've made will help us get back to the true empire track. However, §YProphet Zul§! has no patience and prefers radical changes to make the Troll Empire great again. He will want to achieve this in a number of ways, and we must be aware of this."
