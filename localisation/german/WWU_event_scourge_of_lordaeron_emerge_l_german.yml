 scourge_of_lordaeron_emerge_events.1.desc: "A great plague has hit the Alliance leader of Lordaeron. A terrible result of this plague is a massive undead rising that has formed into a proper military force. The Scourge of Lordaeron have arrived! They are ruled by a fearsome Dreadlord named Mal'Ganis and are devastating the regions around Andorhal, Stratholme and the Capital City. After initial conflicts, the Prince Arthas Menethil has headed to Northrend to finish his confrontation with this new Scourge threat. Surely he will defeat them there?"
