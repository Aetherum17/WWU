 corruption_of_the_ruler_to_the_death_desc: "Under the shadowy influence of the Cult of the Damned, your ruler is tempted by the promise of power beyond mortal comprehension.

This experiment in death will bind your leader to the will of the Lich King, potentially leading to the corruption of your entire nation. The path to power comes with a heavy price, as the very essence of life and death becomes entwined with the chilling grasp of the Scourge."
