 get_out_of_hiding_title: "Break Out of Hiding"
 get_out_of_hiding_desc: "Most $CULTURE$ facilities in $COUNTRY$ are hidden beneath the ground or sealed using ancient magics. Outside levels are usually populated by golems, small constructs and common titan devices. We can disable the seal and come out of hiding as court. This will drastically lower our defenses but allow us interact with surface races more efficiently.\n\nThis decision will also render us susceptible to religious conversion." 
 go_into_hiding_title: "Go into Hiding"
 go_into_hiding_desc: "We can hide ourselves into the ground once again and seal our facilities. This will increase our defenses but we will have less chance to interact with outside nations. This also render us immune to religious conversion."
